        <p class="lead mb-4">We welcome you to Angela Sanchez's page, where you can find one of New York's best-selling authors. She has a wide range of skills from writing that depicts the modern world in a new imaginative way that can range from fantasy worlds filled with magic and strong female leads and modern writing that details the modern world in detail. She grew up in Riverside, California and loved reading and writing short stroies from a very young age. Angela's first novel, Family Threat, was published in 2019. Family threat was considered and described as "thrilling, enthralling, and beautifilly written" by Madrigal's Reading Choice Awards, leading for the book to be placed in the Library Association's Best Books. Angela then proceeded to publish a second book, Family Betrayal, in 2020, which spent three weeks on the New York Times bestseller list. <br><br>

        Bailey Heilman, a Caldecott Award-winning artist, was one of the authors Angela teamed up with to create the best-selling series titled The Smiling Flowers. "Breathtaking and addictive," have been praised for the five rich-written books. Angela decided in 2021 to take a year off from creating wonderful worlds to spend more time with her family and herself. However, she could not control her passion for writing incredible stories, even during her break, which led to her most famous Romantic Comedy stand-alone novel in late 2021, The Good and Bad Romance. The story revolved around the experiences of two young women entering college and discovering their true adult selves while falling in love with each other. The novel ended up taking part as a finalist in the Lodestar Award and has received numerous critical acclaims from various sources, such as the Publishers Weekly and School Library Journal. Her passion for writing was inspired by this. She kept doing what she loved, writing.<br><br>

        Because Angelaâ€™s passion keeps growing, she has decided to create a website where many other passionate and aspiring authors are able to create their own stories in their own time. With an opportunity like this, many underground authors have the privilege and opportunity to publish their work to the public and potential publishing companies in search of new imaginative worlds. It is said that this website, if successful, can be launched for the first time and made accessible to the public as early as July 2022. The website is dedicated to getting rid of the overwhelming fear that comes with writing and publishing a book. With this website, any author and creative writer are able to work and publish chapter by chapter every day, week, or month. The goal is to be able to work stress-free and happily. Angela is a firm believer that an author has the best stories to tell when they are happy and excited to write, not when they feel under pressure and forced to finish a novel by a certain time.
